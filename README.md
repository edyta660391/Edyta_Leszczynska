## **About me**

My name is Edyta Leszczyńska. I have been working for a telecommunications company for over 8 years. I started as a sales consultant and now I am a Senior Consultant for complaints and customer service. I have experience in working with business and individual customers. 

With my diverse experience, I have highly developed interpersonal skills. I am a communicative person. I can handle difficult situations and work in a team. In my work I often have to be creative and work under time pressure. I always strive to achieve my goals. 

In addition to processing complaints, in my work I am involved in the process of maintaining the quality of service. I am also involved in reporting and fixing system errors ( within my competence). I also participated in the testing of our internal web application, based on the received ready-made test cases. Bugs found by me was reported to the test manager using Excel file.

Recently, I also participated in the testing process of the TV, mobile and web application ( even before the launch of this service for sale). In this cases I did not have any test cases or scenarios prepared, I have been following processes and using my experience. Bugs found by me was reported to a file on the SharePoint. 

The above things made that I want to be a Software Tester. A few months ago, I started learning. I started by reading blogs, books and then finished some courses about testing and more.
I would like to exhibit my technical skills which I gained and I will continue to develop in this field. 

So I want to start working as a Software Tester and continue to grow in this subject all the time.
